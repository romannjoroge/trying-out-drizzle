# Introduction
This repository is meant to serve as an example of a drizzle project and will hopefully help guys who want a quick refresher or are learning about drizzle. From using it I can tell that Drizzle is really helpful when it comes to querying the database. The typing of database queries beats creating your own types when processing raw database queries.

Furthermore the kit allowing you to perform migrations beats writting down the queries manually and is in my opinion a more reliable method of updating a database. And finally drizzle coupled with using a postgres container makes the ultimate development experience with one being able to set up a database very quickly and more importantly having easier replicability of configurations.

I go through drizzle in more details here [Drizzle Guide](https://app.eraser.io/#N9pW8-f46nkzrFYEp--AM)
